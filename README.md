HackerRank problems with solutions in haskell.

Challenging with a twist - edge cases and timed executions.

Not all the code included in solutions is mine. In some files I included solutions where I had
to research or just plain couldn't solve the problem with my skills. I like to include the solutions
for study and in some cases - where I found a solution - compare my solution with others.

I did study the solutions to the problems, looking at several languages.
Haskell has a special place in my coded heart.
